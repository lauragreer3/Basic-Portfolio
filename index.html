            <p>I'm not really sure what to say about myself. I decided to take courses in web development to expand my knowledge base and open up more job opportunities for myself. I've worked for several tech companies and I love the flexability these kinds of jobs can have.</p>

            <p>I am a workaholic and I love to travel. I've been to 4 of the 7 continents, but should have been 6. I'm a Disney addict - I've been to a Disney theme park at least 15 times and two were this year. Once in Shanghai this April and WDW in Orlando this October. I love the 80s and a couple favorite bands are Depeche Mode and The Cure. I enjoy watching movies and usually have a useless or useful knowledge base of movie quotes stored up to use at any given time ;-) </p>
